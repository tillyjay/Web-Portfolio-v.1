                            The application is an interface where the user can select three different 
                            cat characteristics and the app will match you with the perfect cat.
                            The site is desktop and mobile friendly.
                            <br><br>
                            The app was created using JavaScriptâ€™s fetch function to grab data from an API, 
                            sort and filter it with three separate JS array methods to return a selected piece of data.
                            The app also leveraged a jQuery library and was styled entirely using SASS.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Working with an API was a challenging new experience but was a great exercise in working with data. 
                            Additionally, this was my first-time using SASS; a bit of a learning curve, but I now understand why 
                            incorporating variables into styling can be super beneficial in writing concise code.

                            Based off an ERD connected to a dynamic MySQL database, a customizable interface was created using Php and the Laravel framework. 
                            The application also included a touch of JavaScript for form validation and was styled using the Bootstrap framework.

                            The project involves developing a WordPress plugin and theme to display a photographer's photo posts. The main page showcases all posts, while each photographer's profile includes
                            contact information and a chronological gallery of their work. A hover effect on the photographerâ€™s name or avatar reveals their three most recent posts with a link to their profile, 
                            and related posts are shown below each post using a tag and category system.

                            <br>
                            The plugin is built using WordPress hooks and filters to ensure adaptability across different themes and layouts. In addition, the project involved custom theme development for specific
