            *Record Scratch* *Freeze Frame* Yep that’s me, Tilly Jay Campbell. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. 
            Let’s rewind 31 years. I was one of those rare millennials who grew up without the internet or even video games, but man was I 
            ever on good terms with the local librarians. So how did I become interested in tech? That comes later. 
        </p>
            <br>
        <p class="aboutP">
            Let’s skip grade school and jump to post university, where I would spend the better part of the next decade travelling and working as I went along. 
            Some call it wanderlust, others call it bad planning. Either way it forced my innately introverted self to develop certain interpersonal skills such 
            as effective communication, collaboration, and empathy. In hindsight, my personal development will always be grateful. 
        </p>
            <br>
        <p id="thirdAP" class="aboutP">
            Fast forward to 26. I’m working a job I love as an assistant for people with intellectual disabilities, but in terms of a career I felt lost. Cue stumbling 
            across a basic HTML/CSS course, and the fascination that came with it. 
        </p>
            <br>
        <p id="fourthAP" class="aboutP">
            Soon after, I made the decision to apply to NSCC’s IT web development program, and here we are. Highlights of my education so far have been spending 9 hours
            to automate a 1-minute task… In all seriousness though, I’ve become passionate about programming, and in particular front-end development.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p id="fifthAP" class="aboutP">
            As a fresh graduate in the vast world of IT, I've embraced the continuous learning that is essential to a career in development, and am excited to see the avenues 
            that my skills may open. To quote the late-great Dr. Seuss, “You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself <br> 
            any direction you choose,” <br> 
            and that is exactly <br> what I intend to do.
