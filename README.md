# web portflio v.1
This project serves as a basic showcase of my work, providing visitors with insight into my skills, work samples, resume, and personal background. As a student at NSCC, I am eager to enhance my coding abilities and create a more robust portfolio in the future. For this particular project, I utilized HTML, CSS (employing flexbox for layout), and JavaScript.

## Features 
- Work Samples: Explore a collection of my coding projects and work samples.
- Resume: View my professional resume to learn more about my skills and experiences.
- About Me: Get to know me better through a brief introduction and insight into my background.
- Contact: Reach out to me through a contact form.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox for layout)
- JavaScript
- PHP

## Challenges 
- Responsiveness was very difficult with simple media queries. Still need to address sizing issues related to responsiveness, such as consistent text styling using the em property and proper breakpoints.
- Absolute positioning of bubbles and ensuring that text on hover appears in center of bubble regardless of screen size.

## Future Improvements 
- Mobile-First Design: Adopt a mobile-first approach to enhance the overall responsiveness of the portfolio.
- Bootstrap Integration: Implement Bootstrap to address layout issues and improve the site's responsiveness.
- Whitespace Enhancement: Add more whitespace around elements to reduce clutter and improve the user experience.
